00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,340
Here we are, three men without a country Where to go, what to do, and how to be

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:21,440
I think we blew our last chance with the home crowd

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:30,440
We took our boats, said goodnight, and took off to where the lights don't reach

4
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:37,940
What do you do when it's all been said? Where do you go when it's all been done?

5
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:46,440
Where do you run when you're alone? When there's no one left to hurt you?

6
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,440
We'll be alright, we have the strength of the three of us

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:04,440
I have a knife to cut you down if you should need me

8
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,940
What do you do when it's all been said? Where do you go when it's all been done?

9
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,940
Where do you run when you're alone? When there's no one left to hurt you?

10
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:39,940
Here we are, three men without a country Where to go, what to do, and how to be

11
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:48,940
I think we blew our last chance with the home crowd

12
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:55,940
We took our boats, said goodnight, and took off to where the lights don't reach

13
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:02,940
What do you do when it's all been said? Where do you go when it's all been done?

14
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:10,940
Where do you run when you're alone? When there's no one left to hurt you?

15
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:35,940
We'll be alright, we have the strength of the three of us

16
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:45,940
I have a knife to cut you down if you should need me
